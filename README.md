# ChessGame_Qt

A modern chess game written in C++ using the Qt framework.

This project was created to explore the **algorithmic implementation of chess logic**, including special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion. It also served as a hands-on introduction to **graphical user interface development** using **Qt**.
A long-term goal is the integration of **machine learning algorithms** in Python.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Implement full chess rules and logic, including special moves
- Design a visual and interactive chessboard including main menu using Qt
- Integrate database for highscores

---

## 🕹️ Current Features

- **Multiplayer Mode** – Two players on the same machine
- **Singleplayer Mode** – Opponent performs random legal moves
- **Graphical UI** – Built with Qt Widgets
- **Move validation** – Enforces legal moves and turn order
